## 🔧 Backend Implementation

### API Endpoint: `/api/feed`
**File:** `apps/api/src/routes/feed.js`

#### Query Parameters
- `filter` - Filter type (all, trending, hot, 50-off, etc.)
- `category` - Category name (electronics, fashion, etc.)
- `limit` - Items per page (default: 20, no max limit)
- `cursor` - Pagination offset

#### Filter Logic

**Price Filters:**
```javascript
filter === 'under-10'  → price < 10
filter === 'under-25'  → price < 25
filter === 'under-50'  → price < 50
```

**Discount Filters:**
```javascript
filter === '50-off'    → discount_percentage >= 50
```

**Time-based Filters:**
```javascript
filter === 'trending'      → created_at >= 7 days ago, sorted by engagement
filter === 'hot'          → created_at >= 1 day ago AND upvotes > 5
filter === 'ending-soon'  → expires_at <= 3 days from now
filter === 'new-arrivals' → created_at >= 3 days ago
```

**Special Filters:**
```javascript
filter === 'freebies'     → price === 0 or null
filter === 'flash-sale'   → discount >= 40% AND expires <= 2 days
filter === 'free-shipping'→ title/description contains "free shipping"
```

**Category Filtering:**
- Searches in `category` field
- Falls back to title/description keyword matching
- Case-insensitive matching

#### Response Format
```json
{
  "data": [...],           // Array of deals/coupons
  "items": [...],          // Same as data (compatibility)
  "nextCursor": 20,        // Next page offset
  "hasMore": true,         // More results available
  "meta": {
    "total": 15,           // Filtered results count
    "deals_count": 10,     // Total deals fetched
    "coupons_count": 5,    // Total coupons fetched
    "filter": "trending",  // Active filter
    "category": null       // Active category
  }
}
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### User Flow
1. **User clicks filter** in sidebar
   → `setFilter('trending')` called
   → State updates in `SocialHomepage`
   
2. **State passed to InfiniteFeed**
   → `<InfiniteFeed filter="trending" />`
   → React Query key changes
   
3. **API request triggered**
   → `GET /api/feed?filter=trending&limit=20`
   → Backend applies filter logic
   
4. **Results displayed**
   → Feed updates with filtered items
   → Active filter banner shows
   → Result count displayed

### Category Flow
Same as above, but with `category` parameter instead of `filter`
